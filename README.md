Models are expected to generalize on data from a different scanner/site (site 2). All subjects from site 2 were assigned to the test set, so their scores are not available. While there are fewer site 2 subjects than site 1 subjects in the test set, the total number of subjects from site 2 will not be revealed until after the end of the competition. To make it more interesting, the IDs of some site 2 subjects have been revealed below. Use this to inform your models about site effects. Site effects are a form of bias. To generalize well, models should learn features that are not related to or driven by site effects.
